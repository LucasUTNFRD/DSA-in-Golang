# Data Structures Implementation in Go
This repository contains my implementation of various data structures, developed as a complement to deepen my understanding of the subject, following the Algorithms and Data Structures 2 course at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Buenos Aires (UBA).

The main goal of this project is to consolidate my understanding of the internal workings of different data structures and to start abstracting from their implementations when used in more complex projects.

To test all the features and projects, you must have Go installed in your computer, and run the following commands in the terminal: 

```
go work init
go work use tdas
go mod tidy
```

The `go work init` will create a workspace that is going to be useful for connecting all the modules and packages.
